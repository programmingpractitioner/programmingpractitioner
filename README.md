- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @programmingpractitioner

It is my hobby to study programming languages that I like, and I found out that I started to lose knowledge of it when I didn't write it much anymore from time to time.

So I do some experiment tests, and I found out that recording video tutorials and teaching others about programming is one of the ways that allows me to improve my memory and knowledge of that languages.

And that led to the birth of this channel.

Welcome to the Programming Practitioner channel!
